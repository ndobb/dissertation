This dissertation describes the development of a novel database query generation system to identify patients eligible for clinical trials using a natural language interface. We conclude with a summary of the primary contributions of this work, a discussion of limitations, and finally remarks on potential directions for future research.

\section{Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Annotated Corpora}: we introduced two new human-annotated corpora, the Leaf Clinical Trials (LCT) corpus and Leaf Logical Forms (LLF) corpus. The LCT corpus includes a highly granular named entity- and relation-based schema 
    \item \textit{Model-agnostic query generation}: 
    \item \textit{Knowledge Base}: 
    \item \textit{Reasoning upon non-specific criteria}: 
    \item \textit{Evaluation against a human programmer and actual trial enrollments}: 
\end{enumerate}
