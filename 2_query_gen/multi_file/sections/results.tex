Results of the query generation experiment are shown in Table \ref{tbl_results}. Overall, LeafAI matched 212 of 427 (49\%) total enrolled patients across 8 clinical trials compared to 180 (42\%) found by queries of the human programmer. The mean per-trial percent of patients matched was 43.5\% for LeafAI and 27.2\% for the human programmer. LeafAI had a greater number of patients deemed eligible across trials, for a total of 27,225 eligible compared to 14,587 found by the human programmer.

    \caption{Statistics for each clinical trial evaluated by the LeafAI query engine and human programmer. The number of enrolled and matched patients were determined by cross-matching enrollments listed within our EHR. The \textit{Time} column indicates the number of hours the human programmer spent developing queries for each trial.}

\end{table} 

Table \ref{tbl_results_leafai_detail} shows the number of criteria which were skipped by LeafAI. Of the 103 total criteria across all 8 studies, LeafAI executed queries for 61 (59.3\%) and skipped 5 (4.8\%) as it found no patients and 42 (40.7\%) because no computable concepts were found.

    \input{tables/results_skipped}
    \caption{The LeafAI query engine's handling of eligibility criteria for each trial. The column \textit{No Patients} indicates the count of criteria which would, if executed, cause no patients to be eligible. The column \textit{Not Computable} indicates the count of criteria which LeafAI could not generate a query for, for various reasons. Both of these types of criteria were ignored by the system.}

Figure \ref{fig_leafai_results_analysis} shows longitudinal results from four trials with commentary indicating differences in query strategy by LeafAI and the human programmer.

  \caption{Longitudinal results listing patients found at each step in the query process for four representative trials. The blue line indicates \% recall for LeafAI and orange that of the human programmer. The X axis represents the line number within the free-text eligibility criteria. Dots indicate that a query was executed for a given line. On the right, boxes represent the text of a given eligibility criteria, with comments below discussing strategies of LeafAI and the human programmer and findings related to available data.}
