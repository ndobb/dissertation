\caption{Longitudinal results listing results of patients found at each step in the query process for each trial. The blue line indicates \% Recall (left-most Y axis) while the gray line indicates the number of eligible patients found (right-most Y axis). The X axis represents the line number within the free-text eligibility criteria. Dots indicate that the LeafAI query engine executed an eligibility criterion query.}

    \caption{The LeafAI query engine's handling of eligibility criteria for each trial. The column \textit{Skipped - No Patients} indicates the count of criteria which would, if executed, cause no patients to be eligible. The column \textit{Skipped - Not Computable} indicates the count of criteria which LeafAI could not generate a query for, for various reasons. Both of these types of criteria were ignored by the system.}
