The growing volume and breadth of clinical data available in EHRs offers great potential sources of information for clinical trial recruitment, but also challenges in sorting, filtering, and making sense of. Automated applications to do so, such as LeafAI, represent a promising direction in expanding potential pools of trial candidates in a fast, scalable, and cost-saving means.

This study introduced LeafAI, a NLP-based system leveraging deep learning and an integrated Knowledge Base which can automatically generate queries for cohort discovery on virtually any clinical data model. Using an OMOP database representing the entire patient population of our institution, we demonstrated that LeafAI is capable of rivaling the performance of a human programmer in identifying eligible patients. We look forward in future work to deploying LeafAI for researchers and collaborating with the research community to expand and improve the tool.
