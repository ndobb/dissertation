\noindent\textbf{Objective:} Finding patients within clinical databases meeting certain criteria is a critical step for clinical trials and biomedical research. Yet accurate query generation often requires extensive technical- and biomedical domain-specific expertise and knowledge of data models and terminologies. Expanding upon previous work, we sought to create a system capable of generating data model-agnostic queries while also providing novel logical reasoning capabilities for complex clinical trial eligibility criteria. \\

\noindent\textbf{Materials and Methods:} The LeafAI query engine utilizes a micro-service-based pipeline approach for query generation using named entity recognition and relation extraction, sequence to sequence transformation into logical intermediate representations, normalization, reasoning using a knowledge base of the UMLS and linked ontologies, and finally query generation using database schema semantic metadata. To evaluate our system, we compared the results of queries generated by LeafAI, a human SQL programmer, and previous work for actual clinical trials at our institution. We measured systems effectiveness using F1 scores of patients found to be eligible by each method as compared to patients actually enrolled in the trials. \\

\noindent\textbf{Results:} TODO \\

\noindent\textbf{Discussion and Conclusion:} Our work contributes a state-of-the-art data model-agnostic query generation system capable of conditional reasoning using a knowledge base. We demonstrate that the LeafAI query engine surpasses patient matching performance of previous work and meets or exceeds that of a human programmer.
