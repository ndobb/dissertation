Randomized clinical trials have a significant impact on biomedical research and the approval of new drugs and methods for treating conditions which affect humans. Finding patients meeting criteria for clinical trials - and medical research in general - is often a time-consuming and difficult challenge. This project aims to use NLP and a user-friendly web application to help researchers accomplish this. In Aim 1, we developed the Leaf Clinical Trials corpus, a gold standard for identifying key elements within eligibility criteria. In Aim 2, we developed the Leaf Logical Forms corpus and developed state-of-the-art methods for generating queries to identify patients meeting eligibility criteria. In Aim 3, we will create an intuitive web application, LeafAI, capable of quickly executing user-defined criteria and transparently explaining its findings.
